# How to use
In order to run the server, just run the following commands in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`
Then go to `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser

# Where to start?
The `/routers/entitle.py` file is the most interesting part of this mock server. Have a look at it!  
The `constants.py` might also be beneficial. Pay attention to the docstring in the top of the file.
